        Hey! I'm a computer engineering graduate who's explored different concepts within computer engineering. While it's
        interesting, what truly fascinates me are fiction books and their immersive world-building.
      
        I often wondered if I could combine my interest in these worlds with technology, leading me to game development with VR.
        However, current games didn't offer the level of immersiveness I desired. I imagined lifelike AI NPCs and realistic
        physics, propelling me toward game research and AI.
      
        With all this in mind, I made the decision to become a full-stack developer. My plan is to secure a full-stack job,
        delve into AI, and ultimately enhance the game development world with AI-powered tools.
