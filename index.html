  <section class="about-container">
    Hey! I'm a computer engineering graduate who's explored different concepts within computer engineering. While it's
    interesting, what truly fascinates me are fiction books and their immersive world-building.
    
    I often wondered if I could combine my interest in these worlds with technology, leading me to game development with VR.
    However, current games didn't offer the level of immersiveness I desired. I imagined lifelike AI NPCs and realistic
    physics, propelling me toward game research and AI.
    
    With all this in mind, I made the decision to become a full-stack developer. My plan is to secure a full-stack job,
    delve into AI, and ultimately enhance the game development world with AI-powered tools.
